# This script tests the perceptual hash similarity between two images using the perceptual hash algorithm.
# It computes the perceptual hash for each image, calculates the Hamming distance between the hashes, and determines if the images are similar based on a specified threshold.
# The perceptual hash algorithm is designed to produce similar hashes for visually similar images, even if they are not identical.
# The Hamming distance is used to quantify the difference between the two hashes, and a similarity percentage is calculated based on this distance.
# The script prints the perceptual hashes, Hamming distance, similarity percentage, and whether the images are considered perceptually similar or different.
